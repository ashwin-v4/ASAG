They checked the temperatures every 5 minutes and made the table below. Which box did Julie build, A or B? What evidence supports your answer?",A. The water in Julie's heater got hotter faster (or had a greater temperature change in 20 minutes). The collector in heater A has the greater surface area so the water in A would get hotter faster than the water in B.,A. Because Julie's had more black flooring. The more black flooring you get the hotter it gets. Julie's side of the chart had the highest temperature. So box A is hers.,0
